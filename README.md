# To do list app
To-do list apps are ideal for managing tasks that don't have specific time constraints or deadlines. We can create lists and organize tasks based on priority or categories.

- We can add our task list and mark that task as completed or incomplete.
- We can write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list.
- We can click on the task name to marl it as completed or incomplete task.
- We will add a close icon to delete the particular task from the ToDoList.
